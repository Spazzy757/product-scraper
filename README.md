# product-scraper

Scripts that scrape websites and structure the product data

_NOTE_: This is just an example, scraping websites is extremly unethical if you ddo not have either the permission of the website or alternatively add headers to the requests so that they can identify your requests

## Usage

```bash
docker-compose up
```

You will have a kibana dashboard to watch at http://localhost:5601 that you can watch the importing

## Notes

- This setup requires a Elasticsearch
- I just added a scrapping of the https://komplett.no products
